# How I Converted Source 1 Maps to Source 2 for TF2 (and How You Can Too)

If you're like me and wanted to convert Source 1 maps and textures to Source 2, it's possible, but it took a bit of figuring out. Here's exactly how I managed it step by step, so you can do it too.

---

## Step 1: Download the Essential Tools

Before diving into the process, you’ll need to download a few tools. These will help extract, convert, and manage the files:

- **GCFScape**: To extract files from `.gcf` or `.vpk` archives.
- **VTFEdit**: To manage and convert textures.
- **Source2Converter**: Available [here](https://github.com/REDxEYE/Source2Converter). This is essential for converting models and maps to Source 2 format.
- **Source 2 Material Importer**: Grab it [here](https://github.com/oskarmikey/source-2-material-importer) to help with materials.
- **Source 2 Community Map Converter**: Used for map conversion.

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your Working Folders

Organization is key. I created a simple folder structure to keep everything in order.

- **Main Folder**: This is your working directory. Create it anywhere—on your desktop, in documents, wherever you like.
  - **Maps Folder**: For the maps you're converting.
  - **Textures Folder**: For textures from Source 1.
  - **Backup Folder**: Trust me, this will save you time. Make sure to back up files before editing.

---

## Step 3: Extracting Maps and Textures

Now, it’s time to extract the maps and textures from Source 1.

1. **Extracting the Maps**:
   - Open **GCFScape** and extract the maps you want to convert into the **Maps** folder you created.
   - I used **Hammer Editor** to fix some issues with the maps before proceeding to conversion. Minor adjustments here save trouble later on.

2. **Extracting Textures**:
   - With **GCFScape**, extract all textures into the **Textures** folder. Keep them separate from the maps for now.

---

## Step 4: Converting the Map

Here’s where the actual map conversion begins:

1. Use **Source 2 Community Map Converter** to decompile and prepare the maps for Source 2.
   - Follow the instructions the tool provides carefully. The map will need to be decompiled before moving further.
   
2. Create a new addon in **CS2 Tools** (available through Steam):
   - Launch CS2 Tools, then create a new addon with your map’s name. Save it and close Steam.

3. Find the addon you just created in the **content** folder within your Steam directory. You’ll come back to this later.

---

## Step 5: Preparing and Cleaning Up the Textures

Next, I needed to prepare the extracted textures for Source 2, while cleaning up unnecessary files:

1. **Move the Textures**:
   - Move the extracted textures from `misc-dir` into the appropriate folders. You want both the texture files (`.vtf`) and material files (`.vmt`) in the same place.

2. **Delete Unnecessary Files**:
   - Go into the **materials/models** folder and delete things like `player`, `workshop`, `v-gui`, and any other folders that aren’t needed for your map conversion.
   - Similarly, go to the **materials** folder and delete irrelevant files like `backpack`, `console`, etc.

3. **Backup Your Textures**:
   - Always back up the textures and `.vmt` files before making any further changes. I made a copy in the **Backup** folder, just in case.

4. **Delete All `.vmt` Files**:
   - In the **materials** folder, search for all `.vmt` files, select them, and delete them. This helps avoid conflicts during the conversion.

---

## Step 6: Importing the Map into Source 2

Now that your files are prepped, you can finalize the map import into Source 2.

1. **Copy Materials Folder**: Copy the materials folder over to your Source 2 addon directory.
2. Open **CS2 Tools**, then load your map in the editor:
   - If the map doesn’t open immediately, go to **Map Editor > Files > Open**, and choose the **Prefab** generated by the Source 2 Community Map Converter.

3. **Debug the Map**:
   - I had to debug several issues, mostly with normals on textures. If you run into missing normals, use any tool you prefer to generate them.
   - Some materials may need manual assignment due to Source 2’s different material naming conventions.

---

## Step 7: Handling and Converting Models

Models need special attention, as the automatic conversion isn’t always perfect.

1. **Create a Models Folder**: In your Source 2 addon directory, create a folder called **models**.
2. **Extract the Models**:
   - Using **GCFScape**, extract models from `misc-dir` and place them in the **models** folder.
   - Clean up unnecessary models, just like with the textures earlier.

3. **Convert Models with Source2Converter**:
   - Run the **Source2Converter** tool and follow its instructions.
   - In my case, the `.vmt` files it created didn’t work out of the box, so I had to fix some manually. If you run into this issue, be prepared to edit them yourself.

---

## Step 8: Recompiling Models with Errors

Unfortunately, not everything will convert perfectly, so manual work is needed to fix models showing errors:

1. **Recompile Models**:
   - Open the addon in Source 2, locate models showing errors, and manually recompile them.
   - Right-click the model, click the purple error icon, select the correct model name, and choose **Recompile**.

2. **Repeat as Needed**:
   - You might have to do this for several models. I had to go through each one until all errors were resolved.

---

## Step 9: Finishing Up

Once everything is converted, there’s still a bit of manual work involved, but the heavy lifting is done. At this point:

- **Reuse Your Assets**: You can now reuse the textures and models across different projects.
- **Keep Tweaking**: It’s a learning process, and you’ll get faster with practice.

---

### Final Thoughts

This method took some trial and error, but it works. Converting from Source 1 to Source 2 isn’t always straightforward, and there’s still plenty of manual work required. However, once you get through the first conversion, you can reuse a lot of the materials and models, which will save you time in future projects.

If you’re attempting this for the first time, just follow these steps, and you’ll get the hang of it!
